The libmrhpsb library is used for platform service development. It includes 
the event send loop as well as a callback structure which allows to react to 
events.

This documentation includes listings for the internal functions, enumerations, 
etc. used by the library itself. These are not meant to be used directly for 
application development but as information for library development.

As such, this documentation is both aimed at developers wanting to write their 
own user platform service as well as library developers wishing to improve 
on the libmrhpsb source.
